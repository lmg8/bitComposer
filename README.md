## Project Details
Create a system that plays an editable tune. It allows you to change what notes are played as the sound loops. It is designed for four speakers that each plays a different note in a pattern. Using the keys on the DE2 board to access a corresponding speaker, you can change the pattern of notes using the switches. Each switch will correspond to one beat, resulting in a loop of 16 beats for 16 switches.

## Inspiration
We were inspired by the Oskar Fischinger google doodle, which allows user to compose a sort beat by choosing a pattern of multiple notes.
